# Liquidity Task

The task is to calculate the liquidity ratio, which allows us to understand much better whether
the ads are popular among seekers.
Based on this, i have prepared an analysis using the available data

<b>Technical part:</b>
1. SQL queries that allow for liquidity calculation - it can be in the form of a separate file
(.sql) or as part of a script in python / R. Configuring a database connection (mysql,
postgesql, etc.) is not necessary, but appreciated.
2. Preparation also in Python / R for calculating liquidity for all users, i.e. we want to get a
list with information about exactly how much liquidity is for each user
Analytical part:
1. Please prepare a complete analysis of the data that was sent, along with the answers to
the following questions
a. What differences do you see between the segments in terms of the data you
have available (including liquidity)?
b. What do you think may affect the higher or lower liquidity level?
